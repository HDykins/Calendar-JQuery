# Calendar-jQuery

Interactive Calendar for the month of November created using jQuery. The calendar can act like a planner in that it can store text inputs on clicking the day, so that you can plan events for each day. Clicking a planned event allows you to edit the stored text.

In this project I took my previous project and refactored all my JavaScript code into jQuery. This project shows that I can use jQuery to create and manipulate DOM nodes and refactor my css stylesheet to SASS. It shows that I understand how jQuery selections work, and the processes that jQuery goes through when it creates and manipulates DOM nodes. It also shows that I really did understand exactly what my base JavaScript was doing for each line of my code.
